Anime and manga are <i>retail products</i>. The purpose of this projoect is to identify what types of words resonate with audiences. This will provide insight into why this series was chosen for an anime adaptation and marketing. 
The second part of this project is to determine if lines from an anime series can serve as training data for text classification.

This project is based on an anime called BLUELOCK. Here's the description of the series from Crunchyroll, since I like the site's copy so much: 

"Japan’s desire for World Cup glory leads the Japanese Football Association to launch a new rigorous training program to find the national team’s next striker. Three hundred high school players are pitted against each other for the position, but only one will come out on top. Who among them will be the striker to usher in a new era of Japanese soccer?"

The first part of this project contains the text transcript from the English dub for Team Z's match vs. Team Y. This match lasts from episodes 4 to the first part of episode 5. 

The second part has lines from the series labeled as "ego" (aka positive in the context of the series) or "neg" for negative (aka negative sentiment also in the context of the series. Lines were manually selected by this analyst. 

<b>Enjoy!</b>
